# CO222-Project

Task:
For this project, you will be writing a C program to solve a crossword puzzle. Your program should read,
from standard input, a puzzle grid and a set of words, and should print the solved puzzle to standard
output.


Specification:
A partially filled puzzle grid will be given in the input with stars, hashes and letters. Stars indicate
blocked cells. Hashes indicate vacant cells needed to be filled with letters. The inputs will also include
the words to be used, one per line, in a random order. If your program finds out that the filling of the
crossword puzzle is impossible with the given words, you should print IMPOSSIBLE.


Input:
The grid followed by an empty line followed by the list of words, one per line (to finish giving words, an
empty line is given).


Output:
The completed puzzle or the message “IMPOSSIBLE”.
